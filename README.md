Railway Reservation System

Summary:
Developed a comprehensive Railway Reservation System using Spring Boot, facilitating efficient management of train schedules, passenger information, and ticket reservations. Utilized Postman for API testing to ensure robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Technologies Used:

Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate
Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL
Tools: Postman, Maven, Git
Languages: Java, SQL
Others: JSON, RESTful APIs
Key Features:

Train Management:

Create: Add new train records including train number, name, source, destination, and schedule.
Read: Retrieve details of trains, filter by various criteria (e.g., source, destination, schedule).
Update: Modify existing train details as needed.
Delete: Remove train records when they are no longer needed.
Passenger Management:

Create: Register new passengers with personal and contact details.
Read: Access information on passengers, including their reservation history.
Update: Update passenger records with new information.
Delete: Remove passenger records as required.
Reservation Management:

Create: Book new tickets by specifying train, passenger, and travel details.
Read: Retrieve ticket details, filter by passenger, train, or travel date.
Update: Modify existing reservations as needed.
Cancel: Cancel reservations and update availability.
API Endpoints:

Train Management:

Create Train: POST /api/trains
Get All Trains: GET /api/trains
Get Train by ID: GET /api/trains/{id}
Update Train: PUT /api/trains/{id}
Delete Train: DELETE /api/trains/{id}

Passenger Management:

Create Passenger: POST /api/passengers
Get All Passengers: GET /api/passengers
Get Passenger by ID: GET /api/passengers/{id}
Update Passenger: PUT /api/passengers/{id}
Delete Passenger: DELETE /api/passengers/{id}

Reservation Management:

Create Reservation: POST /api/reservations
Get All Reservations: GET /api/reservations
Get Reservation by ID: GET /api/reservations/{id}
Update Reservation: PUT /api/reservations/{id}
Cancel Reservation: DELETE /api/reservations/{id}

API Testing and Validation:

Postman:
Designed and executed test cases for all CRUD operations.
Validated API endpoints to ensure correct functionality and data integrity.
Automated testing scripts to streamline the validation process.
Challenges and Solutions:

Database Optimization:
Implemented indexing and optimized queries to handle large datasets efficiently.
Concurrent Access:
Addressed issues related to concurrent access and updates using transaction management and locking mechanisms.
Error Handling:
Developed comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms to capture and address issues promptly.
Outcome:
Successfully deployed the system, resulting in improved efficiency in managing train schedules, passenger information, and ticket reservations. The project demonstrated a solid understanding of Spring Boot, RESTful API development, and effective use of Postman for API testing.
